# up221-will
This is Will Callan's repository for UP 221, an intro python course for urban planners focused on spatial data science. I'm a second-year MURP from San Francisco. I'm interested in urban water resources and currently working on a project helping small water providers in the Antelope Valley plan for drought. I would like to use UP 221 to conduct spatial analyses on this topic and in this geographic area. Broadly, I would like to use this course to develop some fundamental python and mapping skills.
